Reflective Analysis:

This map was designed for mobile phones and tablets to help drivers locate the closest electric charging station near schools. The map attempts to show the lack of electric charging stations for electric vehicles in nearby schools and communities across the City of Vancouver. This map is meant to demonstrate the lack of electric charging stations for parents driving electric/hybrid vehicles to school with their children. Some elements of the map were removed such as the name of the city, city districts (such as Killarney, Shaughnessy, Point Grey, etc). These distracting elements were removed to allow easier navigation of the map. It allows the reader to focus on the objective of the map which is to determine the nearest schools and charging stations within the area. The visual effect was created to be pleasing for the reader to navigate on any device such as a smartphone, computer, or tablet and was created to minimize distraction. 

I designed the map to after zooming in at or greater than 11.5x zoom. It allows the user to quickly locate where his or her destination is and allows the user to identify nearby charging stations. This was also done so that points appear do not overlap with one another. This map can be improved by using points for electric charging stations. If possible, we could enable text that allows the user to estimate the distance between their location and the nearest charging station. We could also include text to indicate whether the electric charging station is compatible with their type of vehicle. As this is a map of the City of Vancouver, we could also grey out cities not part of Vancouver such as Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Overall, the map allows the user to navigate the city with their electric vehichle.

Nice base map and colours.Really contrasts with the points. Since some points do overlap at certain zoomlengths, I would change the opacity and maybe add a thin stroke line around the points. The neon green can be toned down as well, to closely match with the purple points (in terms of boldness) overall, nice map!

From Vicky J

Hey!! So cool map but I donâ€™t know the difference between the purple and green charging stations as well as when I zoom out all the charging stations disappear.....
Jassen was able to get a different symbol for his points, so maybe you can look into switching the symbols for the schools??? Because then it would be a little bit more obvious?

Nice base map and colours. I really like what you did with the colours. Really suits the overall aesthetic. Just one thing I noticed though I noticed that the smaller streets were not white. It was a bit confusing for me at first since they blended in with your symbols but other then that I love your map
