Reflective Analysis:

This map was designed for mobile phones and tablets to help drivers locate the closest electric charging station near schools. The map attempts to show the lack of electric charging stations for electric vehicles in nearby schools and communities across the City of Vancouver. The Green dots are schools and the purple dots are charging stations. The map basically shows the lack of charging stations near schools and it doesn't help parents charge their electric/hybrid vehicles. Some elements of the map were removed such as the name of the city, city districts (such as Killarney, Shaughnessy, Point Grey, etc) to remove distracting elements. It allows the reader to focus on the objective of the map which is to determine the nearest schools and charging stations within the area. The visual effect was created to be pleasing for the reader to navigate on any device such as a smartphone, computer, or tablet and was created to minimize distraction. 

I designed the map to after zooming in at or greater than 11.5x zoom. It allows the user to quickly locate where his or her destination is and allows the user to identify nearby charging stations. This was also done so that points appear do not overlap with one another, allowing ease of use. The map was also designed this way to show a lack of charging stations across the city of Vancouver. This map can be improved by using points for electric charging stations. Dots can remain for schools within the city. This is important as it allows the user to differentiate between a charging station and a school. If possible, we could enable texts for schools and charging stations so that the reader can guess and estimate the location of the nearest charging station. As this is a map of the City of Vancouver, we could also grey out cities not part of Vancouver such as Burnaby, Richmond, etc.
